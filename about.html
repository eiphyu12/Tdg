                    It is common for Buddhists to go to pagodas and monasteries to pay their respects to monks and offer food.
                    The annual event is also an opportunity for the young to pay respect and give thanks to their elders especially parents, teachers, and elderly relatives. They ask for forgiveness for wrongdoings committed during the year and often receive pocket money in return.
